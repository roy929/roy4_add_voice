voice_chat
1. you need to use python 3.6 and import pyaudio and the flask has requirements.txt, download it
2. you need to run 'basicRest' and 'server' and 'client'
3. now run 'firstpage', in it register twice to have 2 accounts that could call each other.
4. click login in 'firstpage', call the other username in 'client' and that's it, both should be in voice chat.
