hi, 
these are instruction for using my code:

first, you need to use python 3.6 and import pyaudio

second, you need to run 'server' and 'service' and 'firstpage'

third, in 'firstpage', you need to register twice to have 2 accounts that could call each other.

fourth, click login in 'firstpage', call the other user and thats it, both should be in voice chat.
